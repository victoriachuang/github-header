# github-header
As of a week ago, Github's dark header is no longer a class you can remove. This extension now makes the header color a random color.

Requests for colors welcome!

### Installation instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Under your Chrome settings, click "Extensions" and enable developer mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked extension", select the repository and enable the extension.
